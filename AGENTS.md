# DWEEB — agent context

Shared context for AI coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, …). This file is the
**single source of truth** for project conventions. When you learn a durable project fact
or receive standing guidance from the maintainer, record it here (public-safe — this repo
is public) or in `AGENTS.local.md` (gitignored — private/ops). Do not keep such facts only
in a tool-private memory store.

> **If `AGENTS.local.md` exists, read it before starting work.** It holds private
> deployment/ops context that must never be committed.

## What this is

Visual Discord webhook & embed builder for Components V2 messages (Preact SPA), plus a
Rust backend (`server/` = API proxy, `plugins/dispatcher` = interaction dispatcher,
plus 7 interaction-plugin crates) and an embedded Discord Activity (collaborative builder).

## Commands

- `bun run dev` — web FE (Vite). `bun run dev:activity` — Activity mode. `bun run dev:server` — Rust proxy.
- `bun run build` — typecheck + Vite build + SEO template pages (`scripts/gen-template-pages.ts`).
- `bun run test` — Vitest (core logic, stores, and feature contracts). `bun run typecheck`, `bun run format:check`.
- Rust has no root workspace. In `server/` and each `plugins/<crate>/`, run
  `cargo fmt --all --check` **before every push**, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  and `cargo test --locked`.
- Bun is the canonical package manager (never commit `package-lock.json`).

## Structure

- `src/core` — non-UI application logic (stores, serialization, validation, API clients,
  telemetry). `src/features` — UI features. `src/activity` — Discord Activity entry.
- `server/src` — Rust API proxy: Discord/OAuth auth, plain-SQLite shortlinks, and
  SQLite-backed schedules/message library/Activity drafts whose sensitive payloads are sealed.
- `plugins/*` — 8 Rust crates total: the dispatcher plus ping-pong, tickets, giveaway,
  quick-replies, self-role, modal-form, and picker.

## Conventions & gotchas (hard-won — do not rediscover)

- **Activity API calls**: the Activity iframe uses bearer auth; cookie-only `/api/guilds/*`
  routes silently 401 inside it. Every Activity-reachable feature needs an `/api/activity/*`
  twin or a dual-credential route, and its FE call must go through `proxyFetch`.
- **Safe-area overlays**: portaled/fixed overlays must use the `--app-sait`/`--app-saib` and
  `--app-sail`/`--app-sair` tokens from `tokens.css`, never raw
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; the floor is stamped via `html[data-activity-platform]`.
- **Adding an interaction plugin** touches the crate, compose service/volume + dispatcher
  `ROUTES`, Caddyfile, registry, `server/gatus/config.yaml`, `plugins-ci.yml` matrix,
  `.github/workflows/plugin-<id>.yml`, and `deploy.yml`'s workflow list. A link plugin is
  registry-only (no backend service). Plugin config iframes are forced dark theme.
- Every interaction plugin must verify custom-app signatures through the dispatcher-forwarded
  key attestation; `DISPATCHER_FORWARD_SECRET` must match the dispatcher and every plugin.
- Plugin-library presets and `init.preset` seeding stay; the duplicate in-config “Quick start”
  bars stay removed.
- **Adding/removing a template**: update `src/data/presets.ts` + `scripts/seo/content.ts`
  (build **throws** if a template has no SEO entry), check `scripts/seo/features.ts` and
  `video/src/data.ts` references, and regenerate committed OG images with
  `bun add -d sharp && bun scripts/gen-template-og.ts && bun remove sharp`.
- **Share-token golden fixtures**: regenerate only via `bun run gen:golden` after a version bump — never hand-edit.
- **Bot permission union** is `805306385`; changing it requires editing
  `src/core/guild/config.ts` + 4 plugin `config.rs` files and per-server bot re-invites.
- Command-set changes must keep `scripts/register-commands.mjs`,
  `server/src/discord.rs::command_set()`, and dispatcher command names/matches aligned.
- Plans (Free/Plus/Pro) are **quota-raising only** — a plan must never lock a feature outright.
  Entitlement is keyed per **guild**, not per user. Guild moves have a 7-day cooldown;
  downgrades keep the oldest resources within cap, suspend overflow, and restore it on upgrade.
- Message library: "posted" is a server-only rolling history window (no local fallback);
  drafts have hard per-plan caps.
- Keep the default `webhook.incoming` OAuth path. Custom bots must not collect bot tokens;
  their OAuth create flow uses the popup/localStorage handshake because Discord can sever
  `window.opener`.
- Link-plugin URLs stay freely editable and the binding follows the URL. Keep one uniform
  link-plugin UI; do not reintroduce per-plugin parameter panels.
- **Discovery marketing**: lead with DWEEB's visual Discord message builder for webhooks,
  embeds, and Components V2. Do not use "without the JSON" copy, and do not present the
  collaborative "Build Together" Activity feature as DWEEB's main functionality.
- **Web Send dialog shows the destination read-only.** When the action bar's channel chip has
  a pick, the Send tab renders `GuildWebhookPicker variant="summary"` — one row for the picked
  channel, no channel list (changing the channel lives in the bar chip; don't reintroduce an
  in-dialog re-pick). The full list appears only when no bar pick exists yet (it's then the
  first pick), and that decision is frozen per dialog open so an in-dialog pick doesn't yank
  the list away mid-flow.

## CI

- `web.yml` — FE build + Vitest + GitHub Pages deploy. `server.yml` — Rust fmt/clippy/test. `plugins-ci.yml` — fmt/clippy/test matrix over all 8 crates. `deploy.yml` — backend CD.
- Pushing `main` triggers deployments; never push unless the maintainer explicitly asks.
